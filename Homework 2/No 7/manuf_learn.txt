Learning Curve Approach," Journal of Manufacturing Systems, Vol. 10, #6,

Description: Results of 2 replicates of a learning curve experiment.
Model fit is:
Y = Cumulative average cost per unit
X1 = cumulative production units
X2 = cumulative training time in hours
Y = B0*(X1^B1)*(X2^B2)*eps    E(eps) = 1
==>  ln(Y) = ln(B0) + B1*ln(X1) + B2*ln(X2) + ln(eps)
